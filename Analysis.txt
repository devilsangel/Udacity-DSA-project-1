Assuming number of call records is N and number of text records is M.

Task0 - This algorithm does not depend on the size of the inputs hence the complexity is O(1)

Task1 - In this algorithm, we loop through both the text and the call records, hence the complexity is O(N + M)

Task2 - In this algorith we loop through the call records to find the longest call, hence the complexity is O(N)

Task3 - In this algorith we loop through the call records to find all the calls made from people in banglore
 and find percentage of them made to people in banglore, hence the complexity is O(N)

Task4 - In this algorithm we loop through both the call and text records while updating a set of telemarketers based on each 
of the records, hence the complexity is O(N + M)
